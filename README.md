# COVID- 19 Vaccinations for international students at JHU

## Background

Earlier this semester Johns Hopkins University announced its plans for the staged return of activity back to its campuses, with the hope and expectation that the university will be substantially back to normal this fall. A fundamental part of this plan is that they will require all students coming or returning to campuses this fall, and who do not require religious or health exemptions, to be vaccinated. As Hopkins has indicated, they strongly urge, and may soon require, all faculty and staff to be vaccinated as well.

Multiple vaccines (from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson) have been demonstrated to provide high levels of protection against the COVID virus with reports of only minimal and brief side effects following administration. However, not all countries have had the same access to vaccinations. As a global university with students from all over the world, it is important for Hopkins to consider the global vaccination accessibility. Therefore, this report is analysis of vaccination trends for five countries from where the largest percentage of international students at Hopkins come from.
